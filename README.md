# Reading in the Data

``` r
data_Total = read_csv("OnlineNewsPopularity.csv")
```

# Data

The Dataset above contains information about articles posted on
[Mashable](https://mashable.com/) that includes measures of sentiment
analysis. Being absolutely no expert in language analysis, I will need
to explore the data before modelling.

Upon review of the data, there are variables that I elected to not
consider for the analysis:

  - `url`  
  - `timedelta`  
  - `Closeness to LDA 0`
  - `Closeness to LDA 1`  
  - `Closeness to LDA 2`  
  - `Closeness to LDA 3`  
  - `Closeness to LDA 4`

URL and timedelta are listed as non-predicting in the dataset, and the
LDA variables are unclear in nature, but I believe they are related to a
natural language processing tool called [Latent Dirichlet
allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation).
Without knowledge of this type of analysis, I felt uncomfortable
including these variables in my own.

``` r
data_Analysis = data_Total %>%
  select(-c(url, timedelta, LDA_00, LDA_01, LDA_02, LDA_03, LDA_04)) %>%
  mutate(
    monday = weekday_is_monday,
    tuesday = weekday_is_tuesday,
    wednesday = weekday_is_wednesday,
    thursday = weekday_is_thursday,
    friday = weekday_is_friday,
    saturday = weekday_is_saturday,
    sunday = weekday_is_sunday,
    .keep = "unused"
  )
```

# Analysis Goals

Overall, the goal of this analysis is to predict the `shares` variable
for each article. While this may be important, I find it more
interesting to attempt to classify a given article as high volume (More
than 1400 shares) or low volume (At most 1400 shares) based on the
variables that we are given. I think this will give us higher predictive
power because models that are built solely on numeric data tend to give
larger errors in extreme cases of only a handful of shares and thousands
of shares. Additionally, we practically care less about the actual
number of shares that a post receives and more about its magnitude. This
analysis will be done for every day of the
week.

``` r
data_Analysis$shares_cat = ifelse(data_Analysis$shares >= 1400, "High", "Low")

data_Day = data_Analysis %>% 
  filter(monday == 1) %>%
  mutate(shares_cat = as.factor(shares_cat))
```

# Train/Test split

Since there is a plethora of data for every day, I will do a 70:30 split
for training/testing respectively

``` r
set.seed(623)
train = sample(1:nrow(data_Day), size = 0.7*nrow(data_Day))
test = dplyr::setdiff(1:nrow(data_Day), train)

data_Train = data_Day[train, ]
data_Test = data_Day[test, ]
```

# Data Exploration

``` r
ggplot(data=data_Train, aes(x=n_tokens_title, y=n_tokens_content))+
  geom_jitter(aes(color=shares_cat))+
  labs(x="Title Characters", y="Content Characters", color="Share Volume", title="Title Vs Content in Characters")
```

To attempt to predict the relative popularity of a post, I will utilize
Logistic regression as a GLM and a random forest fit and tuned on a
training set and evaluated on a test set using misclassification rate as
the metric for selecting a better fitting model.

First, I need to grab the numeric variables from the training set

``` r
train_num = data_Train %>%
  select(-c(is_weekend,
            monday,
            tuesday,
            wednesday,
            thursday,
            friday,
            saturday,
            sunday,
            shares))
```

# Fitting a Logistic Regression Model to the training set

``` r
logistic_Fit = glm(shares_cat ~ ., data=train_num, family="binomial")
```
